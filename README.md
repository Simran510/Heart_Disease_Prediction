# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
üìå Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes. Using machine learning algorithms, we train a model on historical data and evaluate its performance to help in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

üìÇ Dataset
Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset or Kaggle equivalent.
Number of Records: 303
Number of Features: 14 (including target variable)
Target Variable: target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

Key Features:
age - Age of the patient
sex - Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp - Chest pain type
trestbps - Resting blood pressure
chol - Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
fbs - Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results
thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved
exang - Exercise induced angina
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal - Thalassemia type
target - Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values

Standardize numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots for each feature
Correlation heatmap to find relationships
Outlier detection
Model Building

Algorithms used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Train-Test Split (e.g., 80%-20%)

Model Evaluation

üöÄ Results
Best Performing Model: Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: 0.85)

Insights:
Features like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression have a strong influence on prediction.
