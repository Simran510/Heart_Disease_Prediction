üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to better understand the dataset, identify patterns, and detect anomalies before model building.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Overview
Rows: 303
Columns: 14 (13 features + 1 target)
No significant missing values detected.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Target Variable Distribution
0 (No Heart Disease): 138 samples
1 (Heart Disease Present): 165 samples
Dataset is slightly imbalanced but manageable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Univariate Analysis
Numerical Features:
Age ranges from 29 to 77 years with a mean of ~54 years.
Cholesterol values vary widely, with some extreme outliers above 500 mg/dl.
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) ranges between 71 and 202 bpm.

Categorical Features:
Chest pain type (cp) shows that type 0 is most common among patients with heart disease.
Exercise-induced angina (exang) is more frequent in heart disease cases.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Bivariate Analysis
Patients with higher maximum heart rate (thalach) tend to have lower chances of heart disease.
Oldpeak (ST depression) values are generally higher in patients with heart disease.
Chest pain type is a strong differentiating feature ‚Äî atypical angina and non-anginal pain occur more in healthy patients.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Analysis
Strong Positive Correlation: cp with target (more chest pain types linked with disease presence).
Strong Negative Correlation: thalach with target (higher heart rate ‚Üí lower risk).
Heatmap shows oldpeak, ca, and exang have noticeable positive correlations with heart disease presence.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Outlier Detection
Outliers detected in chol (very high cholesterol levels) and trestbps (resting blood pressure).
Retained for modeling as they could represent real-world extreme cases.

‚úÖ Conclusion from EDA:

Features like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, ST depression, and number of major vessels are strong predictors.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insights from EDA
Middle-aged individuals (40‚Äì60 years) are at highest risk.
Higher cholesterol and resting BP are moderately linked with disease.
Chest pain type and max heart rate are among the most influential features.
No severe data imbalance, making the dataset ideal for classification algorithms.
